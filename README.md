My experiments with tensor flow

# Linear Regression
- Based on https://cs224d.stanford.edu/lectures/CS224d-Lecture7.pdf

- You can visualize the variables and resulting loss functions over iterations by
using tensorboard

- Initial values really matter. If your initial guess if way off, reduce the
  learning rate and increase the number of iterations
